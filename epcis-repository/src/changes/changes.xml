            <!-- general changes -->
            <action dev="steybem" type="add">
                Introduced Spring IoC container for bean wiring and
                application initialization.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="add">
                Introduced interfaces wherever reasonable (program to an
                interface, not an implementation), and improved
                extensibility and interoperability through application
                layering.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="add">
                Added a context listener which performs the
                initialization work (e.g., initializing the logging
                subsystem) when the application is deployed.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="add">
                Added support for storing custom, non-standard
                vocabulary fields.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="update">
                Improved and centralized all configuration parameters in
                a consistent application.properties file.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="update">
                Use StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer or string
                concatenation wherever reasonable, for improved
                performance.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="update">
                Use the commons-logging API as a wrapper for Log4J for
                all the log statements.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="update">
                Added database indexes wherever reasonable for improved
                performance.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="remove">
                Removed EPCIS WSDL and schema files - they will now be
                provided by epcis-commons and will be available on the
                classpath.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="remove">
                Removed 'vocabularies' table from the database schema -
                the mapping of vocabulary names to the corresponding
                database table is now handled in the code.
            </action>
            <!-- changes to query interface -->
            <action dev="steybem" type="add">
                Query Interface: replaced the Web service framework
                Apache Axis 1 with Apache CXF which prevents many
                problems and avoids many workarounds implied by Axis,
                and improves performance.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="add">
                Query Interface: introduced a JAXB data binding to map
                Web service requests and responses to Java beans.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="add">

                non-standard vocabulary fields.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="add">
                Query Interface: added a servlet to perform the
                initialization work for the QueryOperationsModule in
                cases where Spring cannot be used.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="add">
                Query Interface: added support for database transactions
                - queries which modify the database (e.g., add
                vocabularies) either succeed or fail in their entirety.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="update">
                Query Interface: standing query results are returned
                within an EPCISQueryDocument whose EPCISBody contains
                the response payload XML, as specified in the EPCIS
                standard.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="update">
                Query Interface: callback of results for standing
                queries is retried (up to 3 times) if the destination
                cannot be reached or in cases of network problems.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="update">
                Query Interface: improved handling of
                children-relationships for masterdata vocabularies.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="fix">
                Query Interface: throw QueryParameterException for any
                invalid user-provided query parameter values.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="fix">
                Query Interface: fixed issues with not releasing
                database connections which prevented sessions from being
                closed under certain conditions and crashed the entire
                repository.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="fix">
                Query Interface: 'getVendorVersion' must return a valid
                URI-formated value.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="fix">
                Query Interface: ordering of events according to the
                'orderBy' and 'orderDirection' query parameters must be
                global across all events.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="fix">
                Query Interface: restriction of events according to
                'eventCountLimit' must be global across all events.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="fix" issue="1876336">

                time frame.
            </action>
            <!-- changes to capture interface -->
            <action dev="steybem" type="add">
                Capture Interface: added initialization logic to the
                CaptureOperationsServlet in cases where Spring cannot be
                used.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="add" due-to="Sean Wellington">
                Capture Interface: introduced Hibernate which replaces
                the JDBC statements for persisting events to the
                database, adds an additional database abstraction layer,
                and thus allows for the possibility of integrating other
                (non-MySQL) data stores.
            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="add" due-to="Sean Wellington">

            <action dev="steybem" type="update">
                Capture Interface: check value of the

            </action>
            <action dev="steybem" type="update">
                Capture Interface: check elements in the 'epcList',
                'childEPCs', and 'parentID' fields to match the pure

                Standard 1.3.1.
            </action>
